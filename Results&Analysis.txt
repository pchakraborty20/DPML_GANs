Discovered Functions/Results:

-> brightness
     - directly linked to magnitude of nv values
     - decreased by sin(~), tan, cub

-> subject
     - almost all first iterations cause displacement
     - 

-> bkgrnd
     -

-> cos
     - no clear interpretation (!)
     - images change drastically between iterations
     - seems to be some periodicity with even iterations

-> cub

-> sin6() [asin6() has opposite effects]
     - small features
	- dims
	- shrinks
     - some (very little) simple translation
     -> sin, asin behave opposite to 6 variations (?)
     - both sin and sin6 increase subject size

-> tan()
     - some change in bkgrnd (reason undetermined)
     - unrecognizable after ~3 iterations (?)
     - shrinks subject

-> jitter
     - SuperJitter is very effective; jitter is good, too
     - might want to find a new adj algo for SJ
